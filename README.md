# earthquakes_flutter

Based off https://github.com/jenmerritt/vue_earthquake_api

Fetches data from USGS earthquakes API and displays the largest earthquakes in a map and table. 
Built using Flutter, compatible with desktop, mobile and web.

Still to do:
- Develop the UI to be fully adaptable e.g. differnet layouts on different sized screens / platforms.

# To run:
1. Clone/Fork/Download this project
2. You may need to get the dependencies. Just save the pubspec.yaml file in VSCode (with the Flutter plugin installed) to auto-run the package getter, or you can run `flutter pub get`.
3. From main.dart, run the application setting the target device as any of desktop, mobile or web. (Note: tested on Mac, iOS and web).
